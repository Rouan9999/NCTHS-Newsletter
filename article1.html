            New Century Technology High School is an amazing school filled with great minds, well-rounded students, and potential. But most importantly, it is also home to A LOT of intelligent computer science driven students. The Web Development Club was founded on the hope of gathering all this talent and putting it to work on a project that uses  their coding skills in a real-life situation. The club was also established to give a glimpse of what it's like to work in the tech industry—as most of us are tech nerds—and to put our best effort forth to achieve success as a team. Our goal was to create an incredible, innovative, and interactive website for our school’s newsletter. We started by learning the basics of web development through FreeCodeCamp. It was going great at first, but we quickly realized that web development is not something you can learn overnight… it is complicated. However, we kept going. We moved on to the website's development, splitting into two teams: the coding team and the graphic design team, mimicking the BIG TECH. It wasn’t easy at first; we encountered many obstacles. 
             </p>
           <p>
            We initially wanted to use 

            VS Code, but that didn’t work out, so we searched for a platform that could support a large group of developers on one site. Replit was our man, but it was supper unreliable . One day it was fine and the other it was blocked. Our Replit url even got blocked once by the Huntsville City Schools admins  for “suspicious activities”. However, after appealing the false block, we were finally unblocked and continued development. We had our own moments too, like when one of our sophomores had to use his phone to code because Replit didn’t work on Chromebooks, or when we had to code at home due to being limited to one meeting day per week(which is all we need and greatly appreciate Mrs.heller for sponsoring us). There were even times during finals week when the Web Development Club became a study hall for cramming students, or when we had to use the Python skills learned in Mr.gore to create a program that handles email notifications for anyone that signs up for the newsletter. After four months of development, we are proud to announce that we are launching a brand new, slick website for our school’s newsletter, which the NCTHS Newspaper Club will take over from here. Expect amazing articles coming soon! 
           </p>

           <p> The Web Development Club's first project has finally been finalized. If you are a tech-devoted student who wants embark with us towards our next to our next project and see what it's like to work in tech as a team, we are the club to join!           </p>

           <p>Join the Web Development Club. It’s more than coding (we promise)!
