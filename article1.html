            The New Century Tech High Web Development Club has been busy these past few months, and we're thrilled to finally unveil our latest project: a brand-new website for our school's newsletter. From the start, our goal was to use our coding skills into a meaningful project that not only showcases our learning but also serves our school community. 
             </p>
           <p>
            Embarking on this journey, we began with the basics of web development through FreeCodeCamp, quickly realizing the complexity behind creating websites. Despite the challenges, we remained determined. Our team was divided into coders and designers, aiming to replicate the collaborative environment found in major tech companies.
           </p>

           <p> Initially, we planned to use VS Code for our development work, but we quickly switched to Replit to better accommodate our team's needs. Although we faced several challenges, including a temporary block by the Huntsville city school administrators due to a misunderstanding, we persevered and continued our work, sometimes resorting to unconventional methods like coding on phones and maximizing our limited meeting time to push the project forward.</p>
           <p> Our club meetings often turned into study sessions during finals week, showing how our club is more than just coding. We also applied Python programming skills, learned in class, to implement email notifications for newsletter sign-ups, applying our coursework knowledge in real world situations.</p>
           <p> Now, after months of dedication, we are proud to launch the new website for the NCTHS newsletter. This platform is now in the capable hands of the Newspaper Club, who will continue to fill it with engaging and informative content for our school community.</p>

           <p>We hope this website becomes a vital resource for school news, events, and student achievements.This project showcases our ability to work together, overcome challenges, and apply what we've learned to something tangible. We're excited to see its future impact, highlighting the power of student teamwork and creativity at New Century Tech High.So Join the Web Development Club and let's embark into our next project.
