           <p>
               In 2022, Child Advocacy Centers across the United States served approximately 380,494 victims of child abuse, of which 104,927 were 6 years of age or younger (Child Welfare Information Gateway). Child abuse can lead to severe consequences for the victim, and while many can be noticed at a glance, such as bruises or lacerations, abuse can have important and long-lasting psychological effects that are much harder to observe. Child abuse can directly cause mental health disorders to develop within the victim, cause certain regions within the victim's brain to improperly form, function, or grow properly, and lead to behavioral issues and juvenile delinquency. Even with treatment, the effects caused by child abuse can linger with the victim for their entire lifetime and cause major disruptions to their quality of life. 
             </p>
           <p>
             To truly grasp why the effects of child maltreatment are so monumentally important, one must first grasp the true scale of the problem. An estimated 600,000 children suffer abuse and neglect per year in the United States, of which over a quarter (28%) are below the age of 3 (National Children’s Alliance). This number is considered to be much lower than the true number of cases, as the majority of childhood maltreatment, unfortunately, goes unreported, with emotional abuse and neglect are the most common forms of unreported maltreatment, due to the lack of physical symptoms and the damage they leave (CDC). However, despite leaving little to no observable trace, these types of maltreatment have just as devastating consequences on the victim’s mental health as physical maltreatment. Despite the number of abuse reports remaining relatively consistent, scientific knowledge of the consequences of child maltreatment on both child development and health. As a result, childhood maltreatment is now well-established as a major risk factor for adult psychopathology. 
           </p>
           <p>
             As stated above, childhood maltreatment has been proven to have a direct correlation to the later development of mental health disorders such as complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), and depression. During a recent meta-analysis, it was found that 46% of individuals with depression report having experienced childhood maltreatment (Nelson et al. 98) Furthermore, 57% of patients with bipolar disorder reported high levels of childhood maltreatment (Post, Robert M., et al). Childhood maltreatment is also associated with an earlier onset of depression, occurring on average 4 years earlier in individuals who have experienced significant childhood maltreatment compared to those without (Withers et al. 502). Consequently, individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment are found to be at a significantly higher risk of suicide and the development of anxiety disorders such as PSTD (Angelakis, Loannis, et al). This is an immense problem, as suicide is already regrettably common among teenagers and young adults, with ages 10-24 accounting for 15% of all suicides (CDC). When coupled with the higher risk of suicide in victims of childhood maltreatment, these statistics present a worrisome outcome for thousands of victims across the globe, if action to prevent child maltreatment is not swiftly undertaken.
